  "Hello students, welcome to the course of Logic & Set Theory.",
	"In this course, I will be teaching you the principles of logic.",
	"Logic is a core component of Computer Science and with this you can control the flow of programs and electrical circuits.",
	"Using these principles, you can build various programs, even a whole computerâ€¦ or a MIND-CONTROL DEVICE, MUHAHAHAHAH..*cough cough*.",
	"Sorry about that, an old habit of mine.",
	"Anyway, there will be sources on the left side. A green colour denotes true and will continue to flow over the wires.",
	"The goal is to get the correct colour on the right side of the circuit as indicated by a little dot. These are called the sinks.",
	"You can do this by grabbing a gate on the right side and putting them inside a socket using [SPACE].",
	"Each gate has different properties, but you have to figure that out on your own as I am too lazy to explain everything to you.",
	"If you are stuck in a puzzle, you can always come to me for help.",
	"Good luck with your endeavours. You will need it, muhahaha!"
