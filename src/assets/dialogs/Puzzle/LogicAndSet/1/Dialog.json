    "Welcome students.",
	"Welcome to the course Logic and Set Theory.",
	"In this course you will be learning how to use logic gates in order to make device perform complex operations.",
	"'But sir... What are logic gates?', you must be wondering right now.",
	"Well. Logic gates are small very simple operations.",
	"Some examples are AND, OR, NOT, etc.",
	"But today we will start by only looking at the AND-gate, and what it does...",
	"What you see before you is the screen where you will be making the complex operations using logic gates.",
	"On the left of the screen, you see a list all logic gates you you have unlocked thusfar.",
	"The number next to them indicates how many you are allowed to use in the current puzzle.",
	"To the right of the logic gates, and above the dialog box, you can find the answering field.",
	"You can drag and drop the logic gates to here",
	"Using the line-button. Will allow you to draw wires between gates.",
	"The trash-button will scrap your current answer, and will allow you to start over",
	"And the checkmark-button will submit your work and have it checked.",
	"If it is correct, you can go to the next puzzle.",
	"Else you can try again.",
	"The hint-button can be found on the bottom of the screen.",
	"If you are stuck. Press this button. It will give useful information.",
	"Next to the hint-button, you can find the exit-button. This button allows you to exit the classroom.",
	"If you then later return, you continue where you left of.",
	"So...",
	"Could you try and some the following problem for me, using the knowlegde you already think you have of the AND operation.",
	"Press the hint-button if you would like a hint."
